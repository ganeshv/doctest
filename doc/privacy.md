Privacy Policy
==============

Your data stays 100% private: _Pigshell_ is a client-side web app.
All the code runs entirely in your browser. The server cannot see a single
bit of your data, like files, photos, friend lists or even your name.

Your pictures, posts and files are fetched to your browser directly from 
the corresponding service like Facebook, Google and Twitter.

We don't even know your email address, so we can't send you email, let alone
give it to others.
